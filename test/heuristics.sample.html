        <h1>Sample News Article for TruLens Testing</h1>
        <div class="byline">By Test Author | October 29, 2025</div>
        
        <p>
            This is a sample article designed to test TruLens extension features. In conclusion, 
            this paragraph contains several AI-like phrases. Furthermore, it demonstrates how 
            the extension might highlight certain patterns. Additionally, the repetitive sentence 
            structure is intentional. Moreover, these transitional phrases are common in 
            AI-generated content.
        </p>

            This paragraph includes polarized language for testing purposes. The radical left-wing 
            agenda has clearly infiltrated our institutions. Patriots know that the deep state is 
            working behind the scenes. This obvious propaganda is being pushed by globalist elites 
            who want to rig the system against everyday Americans.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now we shift to bias markers. Clearly, this is the most shocking development in recent 
            history. Obviously, everyone knows that these baseless allegations are disgraceful. 
            Allegedly, sources say that this outrageous situation represents a massive failure. 
            Many say this is undeniably the worst crisis we've seen.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here is a more neutral paragraph for comparison. According to data from the Census Bureau, 
            population growth has slowed in recent years. Researchers at the university published 
            findings in the peer-reviewed journal. The study examined patterns over a ten-year period 
            and controlled for various demographic factors.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Mixed content paragraph: while some experts argue that the situation requires immediate 
            attention, others suggest a more measured approach. The data shows both positive and 
            negative trends. Different stakeholders have expressed varying perspectives on the issue.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In summary, this test article contains examples of AI-like text patterns, polarized 
            language, bias markers, and neutral reporting styles. Furthermore, it is designed to 
            trigger various heuristic signals. Additionally, testers can verify that highlights 
            appear correctly. Moreover, the perspective check should show diverse links.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Final paragraph: This tool is meant to help readers think critically about the content 
            they consume. It provides signals, not verdicts. Users should always verify information 
            through multiple trusted sources and apply their own judgment.
